# Test-Project: Asset Valuation & Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on **asset valuation, exploratory analytics, and predictive modeling** using two datasets.  
It integrates **statistical methods, GIS spatial analysis, and machine learning models** to estimate asset values, build an interactive dashboard, and classify assets into meaningful categories.

---

## üéØ Objectives & Tasks

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Asset Valuation
- Estimate values of assets in **Dataset 1** using information from **Dataset 2**.
- Develop a **valuation model** that captures:
  - Market-driven price variations.
  - Asset-level features (size, type, year, etc.).
  - Spatial/geographical influences (region, ZIP codes).
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as **R¬≤, RMSE, and MAE**.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Analytical Dashboard
- Build an **interactive dashboard** for asset insights.
- Include **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Price distributions, trends, and utilization levels.
  - Regional/cluster-level summaries.
- Apply **Inferential Statistics**:
  - Hypothesis testing (metro vs non-metro, old vs new assets, etc.).
  - Confidence intervals for valuation estimates.
- Utilize **GIS libraries** (e.g., Folium, GeoPandas) to:
  - Visualize spatial distribution of assets.
  - Identify metro vs periphery divides.
  - Map hotspots of growth or decline.

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Machine Learning Models
- **Unsupervised Learning:**
  - Apply clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to create asset classes based on price, location, and features.
  - Identify high-performing vs underperforming clusters.
- **Supervised Learning:**
  - Build predictive models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to classify and predict assets by valuation category.
  - Use the valuation model from Task 1 as the target variable for classification.
